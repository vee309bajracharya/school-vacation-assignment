            Welcome to Euro School, a balanced modern school dedicated to
            produce bright minds for future Nepal and the world.

            <br />
            <br />
            In 2007, Euro Kids (Tangal) successfully introduced international
            standards for preschool education in Nepal, Its success led to the
            birth of Euro School on 19th April, 2008. The school was shifted to
            Hadigaun after two years as the number of students increased. In
            2017, the school was shifted to New Colony, Hattigauda where better
            infrastructure is provided.
            <br />
            <br />

            Our school is a learning center, a laboratory, where students
            develop ideas and understanding pursuit, passion and dreams and hold
            themselves and their classmates accountable for shared and
            individual work.
